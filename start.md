<div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p><strong>Welcome to ResourceDAO</strong></p>
    <p>
      ResourceDAO is very new; we may change as tech expands but the goal will remain. Consulting and building permaweb projects and supporting the web3 ecosystem. There will be NFT's, tokens and a chain if the team can figure out a way to do dPoW effectively but right now we are community growing and focusing on tech & ensure the tokenomics are fair for all parties involved.
    </p>
</div>
